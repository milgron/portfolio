My design philosophy is based on functional minimalism. I firmly believe that more is not always better and that clarity should prevail over complexity. Each product I design and develop aims to make users' lives and work simpler and more efficient.

My core values include:

* Functionality over aesthetics, without sacrificing visual appeal.
* Respect for the user's attentional health.
* Ethical design that considers the user's overall well-being.
* Teamwork and community over personal advantage.

I strive to create products that not only fulfill their purpose but also respect the user's time and attention. Ethics is a fundamental aspect at every stage of my creative process, ensuring that each solution is not only effective but also responsible and user-centered.
