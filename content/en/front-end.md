With solid knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, my expertise focuses on VueJS and NuxtJS, although I also have experience with ReactJS and NextJS. My background includes work with MongoDB, SQLite, NodeJS, and testing with Cypress.

Highlights of my frontend experience:

* Leadership in frontend projects.
* Development of projects where animation and UX are fundamental and distinctive elements.
* Experience in migrating from Vue 1 to Vue 2, and from Vue 2 to Vue 3.

My unique approach lies in the seamless integration between design and frontend development. This allows me to create MVPs that cleanly evolve into production products, always keeping UX as a priority. I have excelled in projects involving interfaces with complex dynamic data, especially in the logistics sector, where efficiency and precision are crucial.
