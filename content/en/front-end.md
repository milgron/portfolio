With solid knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks, with extensive experience in both Vue.js (VueJS/NuxtJS) and React (ReactJS/NextJS/React Native) ecosystems. On the backend side, I work with NodeJS and have hands-on experience with various database technologies including PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for document-based storage, and SQLite for lightweight applications. My testing expertise includes Cypress for end-to-end testing.

Highlights of my front-end experience:

* Leadership in full-stack JavaScript projects
* Development of applications with complex animations and exceptional UX
* Experience in framework migrations and version updates (Vue 1 to 2, Vue 2 to 3, React class components to hooks)

My unique approach lies in the seamless integration between design and development across the full stack. This allows me to create MVPs that cleanly evolve into production products, always keeping UX as a priority. I have excelled in projects involving interfaces with complex dynamic data, especially in the logistics sector, where efficiency and precision are crucial.
