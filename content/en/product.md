In product conception, my holistic approach combines design and front-end development to create solutions aimed at improving user experience. My methodology spans from capturing needs to implementing and validating hypotheses.

I've conceptualized applications ranging from logistics systems handling thousands of daily shipments to insurance claim management platforms. In these projects, I've addressed crucial aspects such as fostering user trust and optimizing the assimilation of large volumes of complex information.

My training and experience allow me to cover the entire spectrum of product development, ensuring that each solution is as effective as it is innovative.
