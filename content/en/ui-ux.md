My UI/UX approach is based on an iterative process that begins with freehand sketches to explore ideas freely, either after conversations with stakeholders or through workshops organized specifically for this purpose. I primarily use Figma for detailed design, complemented by Procreate for illustrations and Adobe suite for image and vector graphics processing.

My experience includes:

* Creating interfaces for complex data management and designing microinteractions that elevate the user experience.
* Developing surveys and analyzing user feedback to inform design decisions.
* Producing design systems to unify communication and interfaces for both internal and client products.
* Product design for various purposes and scales of use.
* Organizing and executing cross-company workshops to establish priorities and conceptualize product areas.
* Founding innovative design methodologies in corporate environments.

Each project is an opportunity to merge aesthetics and functionality, creating interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and efficient.
