My UI/UX approach is based on an iterative process that begins with freehand sketches to explore ideas freely, either after conversations with stakeholders or through workshops organized specifically for this purpose. I primarily use Figma for detailed design, complemented by Procreate for illustrations and Adobe suite for image and vector graphics processing.

My experience includes:

* Designing and implementing interfaces across diverse industries, from fintech to e-commerce, always prioritizing the balance between functionality and development time.
* Creating efficient data visualization solutions that simplify complex information while maintaining usability.
* Developing surveys and conducting user research to validate design decisions and optimize time-to-market.
* Building scalable design systems that accelerate development while maintaining consistency across products.
* Leading cross-functional workshops to align business goals with user needs and technical constraints.
* Establishing agile design methodologies that improve team collaboration and delivery speed.

Each project is an opportunity to find the sweet spot between aesthetics, functionality, and development efficiency. My focus is on creating interfaces that not only look great but also deliver measurable business value within realistic timeframes.
